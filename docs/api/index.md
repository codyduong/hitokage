# API

Lua API references for _hitokage_. They are autogenerated from [ `hitokage-lua-lib` ](https://github.com/codyduong/hitokage/tree/master/hitokage-lua-lib) using [Lua Language Server (LuaLS)](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server).

It is recommended to setup using LuaLS to reference _hitokage_'s lua API, see [Setting up Lua Language Server](../configuration.html#setting-up-lua-language-server).

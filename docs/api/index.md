# API

!!! note inline end

    Many API references are stubs or missing content due
    to limitations of the LuaLS documentation generator. See [issue #54](https://github.com/codyduong/hitokage/issues/53)

Lua API references for _hitokage_. They are autogenerated from [ `hitokage-lua-lib` ](https://github.com/codyduong/hitokage/tree/master/hitokage-lua-lib) using [Lua Language Server (LuaLS)](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server).

It is recommended to setup using LuaLS to reference _hitokage_'s lua API, see [Setting up Lua Language Server](../configuration.html#setting-up-lua-language-server).
